# Data Model

This document describes the data structure for the Physical AI Digital Book. Given the project is a static site generated by Docusaurus, the data model is primarily defined by the file and directory structure rather than a traditional database schema.

## Core Entities

### 1. Book

The `Book` is the top-level entity, representing the entire Docusaurus project.

-   **Type**: Docusaurus Project
-   **Source**: The entire repository, configured by `docusaurus.config.js`.
-   **Attributes**:
    -   `title`: "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics – From Simulation to Embodied Intelligence"
    -   `theme`: Dark mode only.
    -   `colors`: A specific palette of blue, green, and dark grays.
    -   `structure`: A collection of Chapters.

### 2. Chapter

A `Chapter` is a single piece of content within the book.

-   **Type**: Markdown File (`.md`)
-   **Source**: A file within the `/docs` directory.
-   **Attributes**:
    -   `id`: The unique identifier used for routing (e.g., `01-why-physical-ai`).
    -   `title`: The human-readable title of the chapter.
    -   `content`: The body of the chapter in Markdown format.
-   **Validation Rules**:
    -   Filename MUST follow the pattern `[NN]-[title-slug].md` (e.g., `01-why-physical-ai.md`).
    -   Each chapter file MUST contain at least three code blocks.
    -   Each chapter file MUST contain at least one diagram or table.

### 3. Chat Message

A `ChatMessage` is a transient entity representing a single message in the chat interface. It is not persisted on any backend.

-   **Type**: JavaScript Object
-   **Source**: Managed by the React chat widget's state.
-   **Attributes**:
    -   `role`: (string) The role of the message author. Either "user" or "assistant".
    -   `content`: (string) The text content of the message.
-   **State Transitions**:
    -   A new "user" message is created when the user submits input.
    -   A new "assistant" message is created upon receiving a successful response from the Jan.ai API.
    -   The collection of `ChatMessage` objects forms the conversation history that is sent with each new API request.
